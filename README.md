This project develops a **Facial Emotion Detection** system to classify emotions like angry, happy, sad, and surprise from facial images. Using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the FER2013 dataset, the model processes grayscale images of 48x48 pixels through layers of convolution, pooling, and dropout to achieve high accuracy. Preprocessing includes normalization and feature extraction to improve predictions. Real-time emotion recognition is enabled with OpenCV, using Haar cascades for face detection and the trained model for emotion classification. This system is ideal for applications in mental health monitoring, customer feedback analysis, and enhancing human-computer interaction.
